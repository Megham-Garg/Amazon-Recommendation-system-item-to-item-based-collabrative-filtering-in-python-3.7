# Music Recommendation System based on item-to-item based collabrative filtering in python 3.7

This is a POC(proof of concept repository)
In task2.py lies the code for recommendation system that uses item to item based collabrative filtering.
Here i am reading sample data from https://static.turi.com/datasets/millionsong/10000.txt and https://static.turi.com/datasets/millionsong/song_data.csv.
I am testing this code for song recommendation for a million song dataset.
I have written a separate module named Recommenders.py for recommendation algorithm that uses co-occourence matrix and imported that module in the task2.py file.
